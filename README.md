The project allows you to make a graph and show it.
The graph consists of nodes and edges that conects between them.
The project also allows you to do algorithms actions on the graph like searching the shotrest path between 2 nodes or more.

The project represent 3 main classes:

data_structor: The class contains classes named DNode, DEdge, DGraph that create nodes, edges and graph that contains them.

algorithms: The class contains graph (created in data_structor) and make algorithms actions on it.

gui: The class can show graph and algorithms actions on it.
